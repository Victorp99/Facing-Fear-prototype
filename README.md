# Facing-Fear-prototype
This is a prototype for a game named Facing Fear that was later fully developed in Construct 2. 
This prototype helped me practice object-oriented style programming and was used to show some basic mechanics of the game, like 
shooting, moving, and health pickups.

How To Play:

To play this game, download the whole package and open package.bluej with the BlueJ IDE.
After that, right click on the Game.java file and click the "new Game()" option. Then press ok.
To play, use the directional buttons to move up, down, left, and right. To shoot, press the space button.
The aim is to kill all the enemies before they kill you. 

Code:

If you just want to look at the code, look for the java files within the fear folder. 
These files include: FacingFear.java, Powerup.java, Rock.java, Game.java, Board.java, and Enemy.java.
Enjoy!
